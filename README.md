# redux-action-logger
A simple, extensible redux middleware system to generate logs from actions. The intent of this library is to make logging and event reporting as simple and consistent as possible. 

Since it plugs into redux via middleware and separate deterministic action handlers can be specified - it is easy to trace the origin of logs and make sure they follow best practices. For large applications it is recommended to have domain specific 'actionHandlers'.
